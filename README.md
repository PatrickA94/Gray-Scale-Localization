# Gray-Scale-Localization


The goal of this project was to put bounding boxes around the objects that moved in various sets of images, libraries such as Open-CV were not allowed. This project was mainly executed using NumPy.

bin_img.py - Contains code for accomplishing this task

patmacmerge.py - Contains code for a faster version which was achieved by not looking at all pixels and only looking at sections.

## Please open Computer Vision Project.ipynb to see a visualization of what is going on to the image data
